Effectively managing sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and certificates within a Kubernetes environmentâ€”while ensuring that this data remains inaccessible to cluster administrators or system operators is a critical requirement for organizations that prioritize strong security and compliance. 

To achieve this level of protection, especially in multi-tenant or regulated environments, several robust strategies and tools can be employed to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to secrets.

Following are some of the best practices and methods to secure secrets in Kubernetes, ensuring that they are not visible to administrators or operators:

== 1. Use a Dedicated External Secrets Manager

*Examples:* HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager

* Secrets are stored outside Kubernetes.
* Applications retrieve secrets at runtime.
* Access is controlled via fine-grained policies.

== 2. Use Kubernetes External Secrets or External Secrets Operator

* Sync secrets from external managers into Kubernetes.
* Can be configured to avoid storing secrets in plaintext.
* Supports runtime injection into pods.

== 3. Encrypt Secrets at Rest with a Custom KMS

* Use a Key Management Service (KMS) like AWS KMS or Vault.
* Secrets are encrypted before being stored in etcd.
* Admins see only encrypted data unless they have decryption access.

== 4. Avoid Mounting Secrets as Environment Variables

* Mount secrets as files instead.
* Use init containers or sidecars to fetch secrets securely.
* Reduces risk of secrets leaking in logs or process listings.

== 5. Use RBAC and Admission Controllers

* Restrict secret access using Kubernetes RBAC.
* Enforce policies with OPA/Gatekeeper or Kyverno.
* Audit access to secrets.

== 6. Zero Trust and Identity-Based Access

* Use SPIFFE/SPIRE or service identity tokens.
* Secrets are fetched based on workload identity.

|===
| Method | Secrets Visible to Admins? | Notes

| Kubernetes Secrets (default)
| Yes
| Base64-encoded, not secure

| Vault / AWS Secrets Manager
| No
| Best for high-security environments

| Sealed Secrets
| Encrypted but stored in Git
| Good for GitOps

| External Secrets Operator
| Depends on config
| Can avoid storing in cluster

| KMS Encryption
| Encrypted in etcd
| Admins may still decrypt if they have access
