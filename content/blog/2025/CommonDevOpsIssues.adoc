== Misconfigured CI/CD Pipelines

What Happens:
- Builds fail unexpectedly.
- Deployments go to the wrong environment.
- Secrets or credentials get exposed.

Example:
A team accidentally deployed a staging build to production because the pipeline lacked environment-specific safeguards.

How to Prevent It:
- Use environment-specific variables and approval gates.
- Store secrets securely (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Implement pipeline linting and testing.

== Lack of Proper Testing Before Deployment

What Happens:
- Bugs reach production.
- Rollbacks become frequent.
- Confidence in releases drops.

Example:
A microservice update passed unit tests but failed integration tests, causing a cascading failure in production.

How to Prevent It:
- Include unit, integration, and smoke tests in the pipeline.
- Use canary or blue-green deployments.
- Automate rollback strategies.

== Poor Secrets Management

What Happens:
- Secrets are hardcoded in code or config files.
- Credentials leak into version control.
- Unauthorized access risks increase.

Example:
An engineer accidentally committed AWS keys to GitHub, leading to a \$5,000 bill from crypto mining bots.

How to Prevent It:
- Use secret scanning tools (e.g., GitGuardian, TruffleHog).
- Rotate secrets regularly.
- Use environment variables or secret managers.

== Inadequate Monitoring and Alerting

What Happens:
- Incidents go unnoticed.
- Alert fatigue from noisy or irrelevant alerts.
- No visibility into system health.

Example:
A payment service went down for 2 hours before anyone noticed—because alerts were misconfigured and routed to an inactive Slack channel.

How to Prevent It:
- Set up meaningful SLOs and SLIs.
- Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager.
- Regularly review and tune alert rules.

== Infrastructure Drift

What Happens:
- Manual changes in production diverge from IaC (Infrastructure as Code).
- Debugging becomes difficult.
- Environments become inconsistent.

Example:
A developer manually patched a production server, which was later overwritten by Terraform during a routine update.

How to Prevent It:
- Enforce IaC with tools like Terraform or Pulumi.
- Use drift detection tools (e.g., Terraform Cloud, AWS Config).
- Automate infrastructure provisioning and updates.

== Tool Overload and Fragmentation

What Happens:
- Teams use too many overlapping tools.
- Onboarding becomes difficult.
- Integration issues arise.

Example:
A team used Jenkins, GitLab CI, and CircleCI simultaneously—leading to confusion over which pipeline was authoritative.

How to Prevent It:
- Standardize tooling across teams.
- Use internal developer platforms (IDPs).
- Document workflows clearly.
