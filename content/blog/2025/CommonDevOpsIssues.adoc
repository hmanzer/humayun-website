I recently had a few hiccups while dealing with our DevOps Pipeline. 

This blog post will hopefully help you understand, the common issues that we deal with DevOps pipeline.
<!--more-->

== Misconfigured CI/CD Pipelines

*Scenario:*  +
- Builds fail unexpectedly.  +
- IAM Roles missing  +
- Secrets missing.  +

*Example:*  +
A team didn't move underlying resources before production release.  +

*How to Prevent It:* +
- Use environment-specific variables and a terraform approval plan +
- Store secrets (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager). +

== Lack of Proper Testing Before Deployment +

*Scenario:* +
- Release fails. +
- Confidence in releases drops. +

*Example:* +
A microservice update passed unit tests but failed integration tests, causing a cascading failure in production. +

*How to Prevent It:* +
- Include unit, integration, and smoke tests in the pipeline. +
- Use canary or blue-green deployments. +
- Automate rollback strategies. +

== Poor Secrets Management +

*Scenario:* +
- Secrets are hardcoded in code or config files. +
- Credentials leak into version control. +
- Unauthorized access risks increase. +

*Example:* +
An engineer accidentally committed AWS keys to GitHub, leading to a \$5,000 bill from crypto mining bots. +

*How to Prevent It:* +
- Use secret scanning tools (e.g., GitGuardian) and do a pre-commit scan. +
- Rotate secrets regularly. +
- Use environment variables or secret managers. +

== Inadequate Monitoring and Alerting +

*Scenario:* +
- Incidents go unnoticed. +
- Alert fatigue from noisy or irrelevant alerts. +
- No visibility into system health. +

*Example:*
A payment service went down for 2 hours before anyone noticed—because alerts were misconfigured and routed to an inactive Slack channel. +

*How to Prevent It:* +
- Set up meaningful SLOs and SLIs. +
- Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager. +
- Regularly review and tune alert rules. +

== Infrastructure Drift +

*Scenario:* +
- Manual changes in production diverge from IaC (Infrastructure as Code). +
- Debugging becomes difficult. +
- Environments become inconsistent. +

*Example:* +
A developer manually patched a production server, which was later overwritten by Terraform during a routine update. +

*How to Prevent It:* +
- Enforce IaC with tools like Terraform or Pulumi. +
- Use drift detection tools (e.g., Terraform Cloud, AWS Config). +
- Automate infrastructure provisioning and updates. +

== Tool Overload and Fragmentation +

*Scenario:* +
- Teams use too many overlapping tools. +
- Onboarding becomes difficult. +
- Integration issues arise. +

*Example:* +
A team used Jenkins, GitLab CI, and CircleCI simultaneously—leading to confusion over which pipeline was authoritative. +

*How to Prevent It:* +
- Standardize tooling across teams. +
- Use internal developer platforms (IDPs). +
- Document workflows clearly. +
